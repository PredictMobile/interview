Some languages are synchronous, JavaScript is asynchronous, explain the difference. 


What are the benefits of a synchronous language?
making it easier to find issues as the lines of code wont run untill all of them have been so it hits an issue 
and the rest of the code after wont run.

its less time consuming as you dont need to wait for each line of code
to run.
