# Q4

What is a ternary, and what ternary operators are available in php 7.4?


What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a ternary?


Here is an example of a set of nested ternaries:
```php
$x = null;
function test(int $x)
{
    return $x > 0 ? $x % 2 !== 0 ? 2 : $x * 3 : 0;
}

$y = test($x);
``` 

What is the value of `$y` when `$x` is:
* 5
* '7'
* 10
* 'a'

That code is hard to read, please rewrite the code to be more readable.
```php
$x = null;
function test(int $x)
{
    
}

$y = test($x);
```
