# Q4

What is a loop?
A loop is when it goes round and round until broken out

What is the practical difference between these 2 loops:
```ts
while(x < 1) {
    x++;
}
```

```ts
do {
    x++;
} while(x < 1);
```
These check the condition at a different point.


What is the value of `x` after each loop if it starts as:
* -1 1 1
* 0 1 1 
* 1 1 2
* 8 8 9
