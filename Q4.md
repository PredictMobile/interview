# Q4

What is a loop?
a loop is a piece of code that continues untill its got what its look for then it will stop.

What is the practical difference between these 2 loops:
```ts
while(x < 1) {
    x++;
}
```

```ts
do {
    x++;
} while(x < 1);
```


What is the value of `x` after each loop if it starts as:
* -1 1 1
* 0 1 1
* 1 1 2
* 8 8 9
