# Q4

What is a loop?
Repeatable peice of code, until something stops it

What is the practical difference between these 2 loops:
```ts
while(x < 1) {
    x++;
}
```

```ts
do {
    x++;
} while(x < 1);
```
do while = runs the code then checks if the condition is met
while = checks if the condition is met then runs the code

What is the value of `x` after each loop if it starts as:
* -1 = 0, 0
* 0 = 1, 1
* 1 = 1, 2
* 8 = 8 , 9
