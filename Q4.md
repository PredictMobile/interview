# Q4

What is a loop?
when a program is ran over and over again

What is the practical difference between these 2 loops:
```ts
while(x < 1) {
    x++;
}
```
the above loop checks if x is less than 1 then increments x by 1 if it is

```ts
do {
    x++;
} while(x < 1);
```
the above loop increments by 1 while x is less than 1

What is the value of `x` after each loop if it starts as:
* -1 2, 1
* 0  1  1
* 1  would not activate code, 2
* 8  would not activate code, 9
