# Q1

What is an 'if' statement and what is an 'if...else' statement? Give examples.

if(x < 3){

}else if(x > 3){

}
 
Generally speaking, when used in a 'if' statement what is the difference between == and === ?

== if values are equal
=== if values and values type are the same

In most circumstances it is best to use ===, explain by example when using == would be better.

If you want to compare something for example a JSON to a var/string
