# Q1

What is an 'if' statement and what is an 'if...else' statement? Give examples.
if x is true then a, if y is true then b, if neither are true then c
 
Generally speaking, when used in a 'if' statement what is the difference between == and === ?
-- is a loose comparison, === have to be same variable

In most circumstances it is best to use ===, explain by example when using == would be better.
