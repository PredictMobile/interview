# Q1

What is an 'if' statement and what is an 'if...else' statement? Give examples.
An if statement says if this is true do this, and if else statement is if this is true then do something else do something different 
 
Generally speaking, when used in a 'if' statement what is the difference between == and === ?
Not sure

'7.2' == 7.2 = true
'7.2' === 7.2 = false

In most circumstances it is best to use ===, explain by example when using == would be better.
When comparing 2 different types, and it's not the type that matters but the content.
