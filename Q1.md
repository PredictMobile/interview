# Q1

What is an 'if' statement and what is an 'if...else' statement? Give examples.

 if numberoffruit = 0 then 
 msgbox("go to store and pickup more fruit")
 end if

 if numberoffruit = 0 then 
 msgbox("go to store and pickup more fruit")
 else if numberoffruit = 10 then
 msgbox("the fruit bowl is at full capacity")
end if
 
Generally speaking, when used in a 'if' statement what is the difference between == and === ?
== is checking if the variable is true
=== 

In most circumstances it is best to use ===, explain by example when using == would be better.
== would be the best to use in an instance where the condition is checking if 0 is the same as false or if 1 is the same as true,
This would be the best time to use == over === as === would check to see if 0 and 1 are the same data type as true and flase, which wouldnt be the case as 0 and 1 are integers, true and false are boolean.
