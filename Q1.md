# Q1

What is an 'if' statement and what is an 'if...else' statement? Give examples.
an if statement is when your asking for something for example  a spcific name
"Mairead" and the Ele is when that value is not correct if you say "skye"
it should have an error message.
 
Generally speaking, when used in a 'if' statement what is the difference between == and === ?
this is less strict as it doesnt check the type and it is a boolean.
it checks the type

In most circumstances it is best to use ===, explain by example when using == would be better.
if you were using a string === would be better because it checks the type
and the value.
