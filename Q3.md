# Q3

What is a ternary, and how do you use them in JS?


What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a ternary?


Here is an example of a set of nested ternaries:
```ts
const test = (x: number) => x > 0 ? x % 2 !== 0 ? x * 2 : x / 2 : 0

const y = test(?);
``` 

What is the value of `y` when `?` is:
* 5
* '7'
* 10
* 'a'
* -1

That code is hard to read, please rewrite the code to be more readable.
```ts
const test = (x: number) => x > 0 ? x % 2 !== 0 ? x * 2 : x / 2 : 0

const y = test(?);
```
