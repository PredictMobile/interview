# Q3

What is a ternary, and how do you use them in JS?
short hand if statement in 3 parts: condition, true and false.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a ternary?
advantage: it gives you a specific answer.
disadvantage: its hard for others to read

Here is an example of a set of nested ternaries:
```ts
const test = (x: number) => x > 0 ? x % 2 !== 0 ? x * 2 : x / 2 : 0

const y = test(?);
``` 

What is the value of `y` when `?` is:
* 5 10
* '7'  exception
* 10 5
* 'a' exception
* -1 0

That code is hard to read, please rewrite the code to be more readable.
```ts
const test = (x: number) => x > 0 ? x % 2 !== 0 ? x * 2 : x / 2 : 0
 If const test = (x: number) => x > 0 ? x % 2 !== 0 ? x * 2 : x / 2
 else  const test = 0
const y = test(?);
```

const test = (x: number) => {
    if (x <= 0) {
        return 0
    }
    if (x % 2 === 0) {
        return x / 2
    }
    return x * 2
}
