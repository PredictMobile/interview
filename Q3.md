# Q3

What is a ternary, and how do you use them in JS?
it is an operator that takes in 3 operands ? : 

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a ternary?
advantages
- 
-
disadvantages
- really hard to read if not written properly
-  

Here is an example of a set of nested ternaries:
```ts
const test = (x: number) => x > 0 ? x % 2 !== 0 ? x * 2 : x / 2 : 0

const y = test(?);
``` 

What is the value of `y` when `?` is:
* 5  value = 10
* '7' error
* 10 value = 5
* 'a' error
* -1 value = 0

That code is hard to read, please rewrite the code to be more readable.
```ts
const test = (x: number) => x > 0 ? x % 2 !== 0 ? x * 2 : x / 2 : 0

const y = test(?);

const test = (x: number) => 

if x > 0 then
 x % 2 



```
