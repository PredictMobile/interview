# Q3

What is a ternary, and how do you use them in JS?
Condenced form of an if statement

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a ternary?
 + : they are condenced, clean code, more efficeint 
 - : do not perform as well as if statements or switch statements when it comes to several conditions

Here is an example of a set of nested ternaries:
```ts
const test = (x: number) => x > 0 ? x % 2 !== 0 ? x * 2 : x / 2 : 0

const y = test(?);
``` 

What is the value of `y` when `?` is:
* 5 = 10
* '7' = error
* 10 = 5
* 'a' = error
* -1 = 0

That code is hard to read, please rewrite the code to be more readable.
```ts
const test = (x: number) => x > 0 ? x % 2 !== 0 ? x * 2 : x / 2 : 0

const test = (x) => {
    if (x <0) {
        return 0
    }
    if (x % 2 ===0) {
        return x / 2
    }
    return x * 2
}

const y = test(?);
```
int test = 0;

if(x > 0){
    if(x % 2 != 0){
        test = x / 2;
    }else{
        test = x * 2;
    }
}else{
    test = 0;
}

int y = test;
