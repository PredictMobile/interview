# Q3

What is a ternary, and how do you use them in JS?
shorthand if statement, statement? true value : false value

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a ternary?


Here is an example of a set of nested ternaries:
```ts
const test = (x: number) => x > 0 ? x % 2 !== 0 ? x * 2 : x / 2 : 0

const y = test(?);
``` 

What is the value of `y` when `?` is:
* 5 10
* '7' exception
* 10 5
* 'a' exception
* -1 0

That code is hard to read, please rewrite the code to be more readable.
```ts
const test = (x: number) => x > 0 ? x % 2 !== 0 ? x * 2 : x / 2 : 0

const y = test(?);
```

if x <= 0:
	y =0
else if x % 2 == 0:
	y = x/2
else:
	y = x*2
