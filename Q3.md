# Q3

What is a ternary, and how do you use them in JS?
var c = condition ? true : false


What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a ternary?
Quicker to write

Could get complicated very fast

Here is an example of a set of nested ternaries:
```ts
const test = (x: number) => { return x > 0 ? x % 2 !== 0 ? x * 2 : x / 2 : 0 }

const y = test(****);
``` 

What is the value of `y` when `****` is:
* 5 10
* '7' 14 Errors
* 10 5
* 'a' Error
* -1 0

That code is hard to read, please rewrite the code to be more readable.
```ts
const test = (x: number) => x > 0 ? x % 2 !== 0 ? x * 2 : x / 2 : 0

const y = test(?);
```

if x > 0 {
  if x % 2 !== 0 {
    return x * 2
 } else {
    return x / 2
  }
} else {
  return 0
}
